# Trajectory Planning

## Launch
To launch the trajectory planner, after correctly sourcing the setup.bash for the workspace, run,

```
ros2 launch trajectory_planning trajectory_planning.launch.py
```

Both the nodes, trajectory_planner and the dummy_data_generator are launched.

## Nodes
### trajectory_planner
simple version of trajectory planner mainly consisting of the motion planner. At present, the trajectory planner accelerates / decelerates to achieve a particular speed. It is also possible to avoid static obstacles.

### dummy_data_generator
generates the data needed for the correct functioning of trajectory_planner node. Currently is responsible to provide the ego position of the vehicle (should finally be received through Carla) and also the suggested trajectory (should finally be received from the aorta_server).

It immitates a controller by setting the ego position to the next point in the newest trajectory generated by the trajectory_planner.

## Rviz
Using the Path plugin for Rviz, the following two topics can be visualized while running the nodes.
- '/aorta/trajectory/altran_rviz': global waypoints suggested by aorta server to be followed
- '/aorta/trajectory/altran_path': trajectory generated by the trajectory_planner

## Output
trajectory messages published on topic '/aorta/trajectory/altran_internal' in every cycle.
## Further Packages

### cubic_spline
cubic polynomial curvature function with respect to arc length

### quintic_polynomials_planner
fifth order polynomial functions of the x and y position of the car

### frenet_optimal_trajectory
logic to generate optimal trajectory considering obstacles and comfort requirements
