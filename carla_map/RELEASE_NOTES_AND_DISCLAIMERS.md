RELEASE NOTES AND DISCLAIMERS

__The following additional terms apply to the "C++ Library for automated driving physics data types", "C++ library for reading OpenDRIVE XML data", 
"C++ library for accessing automated driving maps" and a set of tools along with this (the “Software”) provided by Intel Corporation (“Intel”) to the recipient (“Recipient”).__

1. The Software implements the following:
  - C++ library for automated driving physics data types (ad_physics)
  - C++ library for reading OpenDRIVE XML data (ad_map_opendrive_reader)
  - C++ library for accessing automated driving maps (ad_map_access)
  - A set of tools to support work with the ad_map_access data

2. Recipient understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Software:
   - is a pre-production version that has only undergone initial testing and should not be considered full, complete or production ready, which may not be fully functional, and which Intel may substantially modify in producing any production version of the Software and/or that is still under development by Intel;
   - does not contain all features slated for development in a production version of the Software;
   - has not been fully tested (including security testing) and may contain bugs, errors or faults;
   - may not be suitable for commercial or production release in its current state; and
   - has not obtained any regulatory approvals (such as, UL or FCC), or obtained any certifications or qualifications (such as, AEC-Q100) and may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments.

3. By using the Software, Recipient agrees to the following:
   - Recipient will be solely responsible for any and all integration tasks, functions, and performance in connection with use of the Software as part of a larger system. Intel has no knowledge of any adjoining, connecting, or component parts used with or possibly impacted by the Software and does not have sufficient knowledge or information about operating conditions or operating environments in which the Software may be used by Recipient. Intel bears no responsibility, liability, or fault for any integration issues associated with the inclusion      of the Software into a system, including but not limited to failure of the Software or as a result of the Software functioning, design, or specifications;
   - Recipient expressly assumes all risks associated with the use of the Software, which are provided “__AS IS__” by Intel with all faults. Specifically, but without limitation, __INTEL DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE__.

4. To the extent Recipient conducts development of transportation applications on test tracks or public roads, the
following applies:
   - It is Recipient’s responsibility to design, manage, and assure safeguards to anticipate, monitor, and control component, system, quality, and or safety failures, and Recipient agrees that Recipient is solely responsible for compliance with all applicable regulatory standards and safety-related requirements concerning Recipient’s use of the Software in Transportation Applications, including U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and applicable regulations in other jurisdictions.
   - Road tests should be conducted and supervised by personnel sufficiently trained in safety methodologies commonly used in this industry for the testing and evaluation of Transportation Applications, including but not limited to any semi-autonomous or autonomous use cases.
   - Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold Intel harmless against any damages, costs, expenses, awards, settlements to third parties, and/or losses arising in any way out of Recipient’s use of the Software in Transportation Applications.
